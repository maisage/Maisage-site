        <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-emerald-900">
          This is the core, structured session where we step back from the chaos and look at the
          whole picture: your current situation, your goals, and the realistic paths available
          over the next few years.

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-xs sm:text-sm text-emerald-900 space-y-1">
          <li>Review where you are now (living situation, support, main worries).</li>
          <li>Clarify your top priorities: independence, money protection, location, family roles.</li>
          <li>Walk through possible paths: staying home, assisted living, nursing home risk, hybrid options.</li>
          <li>Identify key systems: Medicare, Medicaid, VA, Social Security, long-term care risk.</li>

          A typical Your Care Path Session is around 60–90 minutes. Pricing is a clear flat fee
          for the session, with any additional project-style work discussed and agreed to in

        When facility care becomes part of the conversation, families often feel overwhelmed by
        ratings, ownership changes, and conflicting stories. Maisage can help organize what is
        publicly knowable about facilities you’re considering.

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-xs sm:text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>A flat fee for a Your Care Path Session.</li>
        <li>Optional time-and-materials billing for deeper research or ongoing support, discussed in advance.</li>
        <li>No commissions, referral fees, or product markups — you are the only paying party.</li>
        <li>Online payment links (for example through Square) will be provided once you confirm the scope.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-slate-700 max-w-3xl">
        Some people may also choose to make small voluntary donations (for example, as little as $1)
        to help support future educational content; when that option is live, it will be clearly
        marked as separate from paid services.
