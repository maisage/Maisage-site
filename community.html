        No one should have to navigate this alone
      </h1>

      <p class="mt-4 text-slate-700 max-w-3xl">
        Maisage is built from lived experience — and it works best when that experience is shared.
        This page is about the people side: volunteers, navigators, family members, and professionals
        who care about transparency, independence, and dignity in aging.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-3 text-slate-700">
        There are no referral fees, commissions, or “preferred providers” here. The goal is to connect
        insight, not to steer you toward any product or facility.

    <!-- How community fits -->
    <section class="border border-slate-200 bg-slate-50 rounded-2xl p-6 space-y-3">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">What “community” means in Maisage</h2>

      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>Families sharing what they’ve learned the hard way, so others don’t have to.</li>
        <li>Volunteers and navigators helping people understand options, not sell solutions.</li>
        <li>Professionals contributing insight without turning it into an advertisement.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500">
        This is not a social network or crisis hotline. It is a slow, steady effort to make real-world
        experience more visible and usable — without exploiting it.

    <!-- Become a Maisage Navigator -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-900">Become a Maisage Navigator</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        A Maisage Navigator is someone who helps others understand the landscape — not someone who gives
        orders or sells services. Navigators might be adult children who’ve been through this once already,
        retired professionals, or people who simply care about clear information.
      </p>

      <div class="grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2">

          <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-emerald-800">
            What Navigators might do
          </h3>
          <ul class="mt-2 list-disc ml-5 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
            <li>Help someone list their options in plain language.</li>
            <li>Walk through Learn, Plan, and Scenarios pages with a family.</li>
            <li>Point people to official sources for their state or situation.</li>
            <li>Flag confusing language or hidden assumptions in materials.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="border border-amber-200 bg-amber-50 rounded-2xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-amber-800">
            What Navigators do <span class="underline">not</span> do
          </h3>
          <ul class="mt-2 list-disc ml-5 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
            <li>Give legal, financial, or medical advice.</li>
            <li>Guarantee outcomes or promote specific providers.</li>
            <li>Pressure anyone into a decision or product.</li>
            <li>Collect or sell personal data.</li>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        If a Navigator program is formally launched, expectations, training, and boundaries will be clearly defined
        before anyone is matched with families.

      <!-- Simple interest form (non-Formspree, just conceptual placeholder) -->
      <div class="border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl p-4 bg-slate-50">
        <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-slate-900">
          Interested in becoming a Navigator?
        </h3>
        <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-700">
          For now, the simplest way to express interest is to use the
          <a href="start-here.html" class="text-emerald-700 hover:underline">Start Here</a> page
          and mention that you’d like to help as a Navigator. Over time, this may become its own form.
        </p>

    <!-- Coverage by region (conceptual) -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-900">Coverage by region (concept, not a directory)</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        The idea of a “coverage map” is simple: show where volunteer Navigators, lived experience,
        and local knowledge are available — not just where facilities are located.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        Until there are enough Navigators to make a real map useful, this section stays conceptual.
        When it goes live, the principles will be:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>No paid placement or “premium listing” for providers.</li>
        <li>Clear labels for volunteers vs professionals.</li>
        <li>No public display of personal contact info without consent.</li>
        <li>Ability for families to search by region and type of help (guidance only, not services).</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500">
        Any future map would be about visibility and connection, not ratings or rankings.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Stories & testimonials (anonymized / consent-based) -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-900">Stories and lessons from real families</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        Honest stories are often more useful than any brochure. Over time, this section can include
        anonymized or consented stories that highlight what went right, what was harder than expected,
        and what people wish they had known earlier.
      </p>

      <div class="grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2">
        <div class="border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-slate-900">
            Example: “We thought hospice covered everything”
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-700">
            A family discovers late that hospice does not cover room and board — and how that changed
            their decisions about where their loved one stayed and how long private funds lasted.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-slate-900">
            Example: “Three siblings, three expectations”
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-700">
            Siblings with different incomes and beliefs about inheritance use a structured conversation
            to agree on who can do what — and what happens if someone’s situation changes.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500">
        These are illustrative patterns, not actual case files. Any real stories shared in the future
        would require explicit consent and careful anonymization where appropriate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Partnerships & acknowledgments -->
    <section class="space-y-3">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-900">Partners and acknowledgments</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        If Maisage ever collaborates with non-profits, academic groups, or community organizations,
        this is where those relationships will be named — along with exactly what they do and
        how money (if any) flows.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>Clear listing of any organizations that help improve the content or tools.</li>
        <li>Disclosure of any funding or grants, if they ever exist.</li>
        <li>No “silent partners” whose influence is hidden from families.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500">
        Right now, this is an intention, not a list. The principle is that any partnership must
        support transparency and independence, not undermine them.
