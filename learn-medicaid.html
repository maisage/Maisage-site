        Medicaid & Long-Term Care
      </h1>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700 max-w-3xl">
        Medicaid plays a major role in long-term care in the United States. Many families use it
        only when savings are gone, but understanding how it works earlier can help you plan with
        more choice and far less crisis.
      </p>

        This page uses only publicly available information — no legal advice, no financial advice,
        and no assumptions about your situation. The goal is clarity.

    <!-- Section: What Medicaid Is -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">What Medicaid actually is</h2>
      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Medicaid is a federal-state program that helps pay for long-term care for people with
        limited income and assets. Unlike Medicare, which mainly covers medical care, Medicaid is
        the primary payer for long-term care in nursing homes and for many home-based services.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        Every state runs Medicaid differently, but the core rules are similar: you must meet
        medical criteria and financial criteria to qualify.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section: What Medicaid Pays For -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">What Medicaid pays for</h2>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">Medicaid may cover:</p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>Nursing home long-term care (room, board, and basic services)</li>
        <li>Some in-home caregiver services under Home & Community Based Services (HCBS)</li>
        <li>Medical transportation in some situations</li>
        <li>Medical equipment and supplies</li>
        <li>Certain therapies depending on the state</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        Medicaid <strong>does not</strong> typically cover:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>Assisted living room and board</li>
        <li>Memory care room and board</li>
        <li>Private caregivers hired outside Medicaid programs</li>
        <li>Rent, utilities, or everyday household costs</li>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
        What is “spend-down” and why does it matter?
      </h2>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Many families hear: <em>“When the money runs out, Medicaid will take over.”</em>
        In reality, Medicaid has strict asset and income rules. To qualify, many people must first
        spend their savings down to their state’s limits.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">Important notes:</p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>The amount you must spend varies by state.</li>
        <li>Some assets are protected (your home, in many cases).</li>
        <li>Transfers to family can be penalized under 5-year look-back rules.</li>
        <li>Your spouse may keep more under “spousal impoverishment” protections.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        Understanding these rules <strong>before</strong> a crisis helps you plan with more control.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section: Look-back -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">The 5-year look-back</h2>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Medicaid reviews financial activity for the 5 years before applying to ensure assets were
        not given away to qualify. If they were, Medicaid applies a penalty period — a time during
        which Medicaid will not pay for care.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        This makes early planning important. A small, thoughtful adjustment made today may avoid a
        crisis later.

    <!-- Section: Nursing home + HCBS -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Nursing homes vs. home-based Medicaid</h2>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        Many states now offer home-based long-term care through HCBS waivers. These programs:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>aim to let people stay at home longer</li>
        <li>may cover caregivers, adult day programs, or respite services</li>
        <li>often have waitlists</li>
        <li>have strict eligibility rules</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        Nursing homes do not have waitlists for Medicaid — but they may not have open Medicaid
        beds, and families must call to verify availability.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Why early planning matters</h2>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Families often wait until a medical event forces a rushed decision. At that point, choices
        shrink and stress rises. Understanding Medicaid early lets you:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>compare nearby facilities before you need one</li>
        <li>plan financially for multiple care paths</li>
        <li>talk openly with family about expectations</li>
        <li>prepare documents and accounts while things are calm</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Section: What Medicaid doesn't decide -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
        What Medicaid cannot decide for you
      </h2>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Medicaid determines eligibility and pays providers — but it does not choose your facility,
        make care decisions, or guide your family through options. Those decisions still fall to
        you and your loved ones.

        Planning ahead lets you keep more control over your future.
