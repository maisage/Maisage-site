        Learn how aging, care, and cost systems really work
      </h1>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        This page explains, in plain language, how some of the major systems around aging — especially
        medication pricing and Medicare — actually work. It is for education only. It does not tell you
        what to choose and does not replace advice from licensed professionals.
      </p>

      <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-slate-500">
        Information here is based on publicly available sources such as Medicare.gov, state agencies, and
        consumer-facing materials. Programs and rules change over time — always verify details through
        official sources before making decisions.

        <li>Understand how money and decisions move through the system</li>

        Understanding Medication Costs
      </h2>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Most people assume medications have a single price. In reality, three pricing systems operate at
        the same time, and each one can give you a different number at the counter.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        <strong>This is just how the system operates, and understanding it helps you navigate it more confidently.</strong>
        Just like driving:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>you learn how the car works</li>
        <li>you learn the rules of the road</li>
        <li>you choose the route that gets you where you want to go</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Medication pricing works the same way. There are different “roads,” different “routes,” and
        different “rules,” and your cost depends on which path you take.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Maisage is built to make this structure clearer so you can choose a more transparent, efficient,
        and cost-aware route for your situation.

          <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
            This is the price you get when you use your insurance. It depends on:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-xs sm:text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
            <li>your deductible</li>
            <li>copay or coinsurance rules</li>
            <li>the drug’s formulary tier (Tier 1, Tier 2, etc.)</li>
            <li>prior authorization requirements</li>
            <li>whether the pharmacy is preferred for your plan</li>
            <li>rates your insurer and its partners have negotiated</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-slate-600">
            Two people on different insurance plans can pay completely different prices for the same medication.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Pharmacy Cash Price -->
        <div class="border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl p-5 bg-white shadow-sm space-y-2">
          <h4 class="text-base font-semibold text-slate-900">2. The pharmacy cash price</h4>
          <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
            Every pharmacy sets its own cash price. It is not tied to your insurance plan.
            It is influenced by:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-xs sm:text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
            <li>how the pharmacy purchases the drug</li>
            <li>store markups and pricing strategy</li>
            <li>how quickly the medication moves</li>
            <li>local business decisions</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-slate-600">
            This is why one pharmacy may charge $8 for a generic and another may charge $132 for the same drug.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Discount Program Price -->
        <div class="border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl p-5 bg-white shadow-sm space-y-2">
          <h4 class="text-base font-semibold text-slate-900">3. The discount program price</h4>
          <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
            Discount programs (such as common coupon or savings cards) use their own contracts. Their prices are:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-xs sm:text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
            <li>separate from insurance pricing</li>
            <li>separate from the pharmacy cash price</li>
            <li>sometimes lower than both</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-slate-600">
            These programs are essentially a third pricing route that sits alongside your insurance and the
            pharmacy’s own cash price.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Which price is real -->

        <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
          All of them — it depends on which route you choose.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
          Just like driving, you can take the highway, side streets, or toll roads and still reach the same
          destination, but with different costs and timing. Medication pricing works the same way: different
          pricing systems can all lead to the same medication, but not at the same price.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-emerald-900">
          Why it’s difficult for anyone to “fix” drug pricing on their own
        </h3>
        <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
          People sometimes imagine that someone with enough money or influence could step in and straighten
          everything out. In reality, medication pricing is not a single system. It is many overlapping systems,
          each with its own rules and contracts.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-xs sm:text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
          <li>
            Manufacturers, insurers, pharmacies, benefit managers, and discount networks all use different contracts
            and pricing structures.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many parts of pricing are governed by federal and state regulations, as well as private agreements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pharmacies and insurers must follow binding contracts and cannot simply change them for individual situations.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
          <strong>The medication pricing system is complicated because it has many separate parts working at once.
          No single person or company can change all of them.</strong>
        </p>

        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-sm sm:text-base text-emerald-900/90 space-y-1">
          <li>Check your insurance price using your plan’s website, app, or pharmacy tool.</li>
          <li>Ask the pharmacy for its cash price.</li>
          <li>Look up the same medication on one or two reputable discount programs.</li>
          <li>Confirm whether your pharmacy is preferred in your insurance network.</li>
          <li>Ask your doctor or pharmacist if there are generic or lower-tier alternatives that may be appropriate.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-emerald-900/80">
          These steps are based on publicly available information and questions you are allowed to ask. For
          specific decisions, always check with your prescriber, pharmacist, or health plan.
