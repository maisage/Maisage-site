  <h1>Facility questions checklist</h1>
  <p>
    Use this as a worksheet for tours and calls with assisted living, memory care, or nursing facilities.
    You don’t have to ask every question — pick the ones that matter most in your situation.
  </p>

  <h2>Basics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What level of care is your facility licensed to provide?</li>
    <li>What happens if care needs increase (for example, more help with transfers or dementia progression)?</li>
    <li>Is there a waitlist, and how does it work?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Staffing and care</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What is your typical staff-to-resident ratio during days, evenings, and nights?</li>
    <li>How do you handle falls, sudden confusion, or medical changes?</li>
    <li>Who coordinates with outside providers (primary care, specialists, home health, hospice)?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Routines and daily life</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What does a typical day look like here?</li>
    <li>How are meals, activities, and quiet time handled?</li>
    <li>How do you accommodate personal preferences (wake times, bathing, religious practices, etc.)?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Costs and contracts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What is included in the base rate? What is billed as an add-on?</li>
    <li>How often do rates increase, and how much notice do families receive?</li>
    <li>Are there community fees, assessment fees, or other one-time charges?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Red flags and follow-up</h2>
  <p>Make notes on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Anything that feels unclear, rushed, or minimized.</li>
    <li>How staff respond to questions about past problems or inspections.</li>
    <li>Whether what you see on the tour matches what you were told.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Print this page or save as PDF and bring it with you. Add your own questions based on your situation.</p>

  <p><strong>Important:</strong> This checklist does not recommend or endorse any facility. It is for planning and question-asking only.</p>
