        You deserve to understand your options long before someone else has to decide for you.

        reflects who you are — not what a crisis or circumstance forces on you.

    <!-- Founding Story -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-900">Why Maisage began</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        Maisage began from a deeply personal place — born out of love, exhaustion, and the realization that 
        although there is a lot of information about aging and care, most of it isn’t clear or easy to understand.
      </p>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        I watched my mother, my mother-in-law, and now my husband’s brother each walk their own end-of-life path.
        Every one of them faced a maze of paperwork, inflated costs, and missing information.
      </p>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        Over and over, I heard the same line — from doctors, social workers, friends, even other families trying to help:<br>
        <span class="font-semibold">“When the money runs out, Medicaid will take over.”</span>
      </p>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        That single line has become the unspoken plan for aging in America.  
        It’s what many families hold onto when money begins to run low, because no one has shown them another option.
        But Medicaid, while essential, was never meant to be the only plan. It steps in only after independence is already gone —
        when choices are no longer fully yours.
      </p>

    <!-- Crisis-mode Decision Making Section -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-900">Why early planning matters</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        And the people making those choices? Too often, they barely know you.
        Estranged adult children, ex-spouses, or distant relatives may suddenly step in after years of silence.
        Health-care professionals who’ve only known you for a week or two are expected to make decisions that shape the rest of your life.
      </p>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        They haven’t had daily interactions with you, nor any meaningful period of time to understand
        your routines, your values, or what brings you comfort.
        It’s a little like going on a few dates and then getting married — no one would expect a lifetime of understanding from such
        a short connection. Yet that is often what happens when decisions fall into <strong>crisis mode</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="text-slate-700 font-medium">
        It’s not fair to you — and it’s certainly not fair to the person who suddenly has to step in and make life-shaping decisions on your behalf.
      </p>

    <!-- Maisage Purpose Section -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-900">What Maisage helps you do</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        I built Maisage to change that pattern.
        You deserve better than last-minute decisions made in fear, confusion, or pressure. 
        You deserve clear information long before you need it — not during a crisis when choices are limited.
      </p>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        <strong>Maisage helps you cut through the noise and build a Golden Years life plan that fits the way you want to live.</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        It arms you with the knowledge and information you need to make informed decisions.
      </p>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        It also helps you understand the realities of aging and care — what different services actually cover,
        what they don’t, and how the costs fit together.
        Whether you're looking at Medicare, Medicaid, home support, assisted living, hospice, or simply staying independent longer,
        Maisage gives you the clarity to make choices that fit your life.
      </p>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        With better understanding, you can plan to live where you feel most comfortable, avoid unexpected costs,
        and prevent the kind of last-minute decisions that disrupt your independence.

    <!-- Family Section -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-900">Bringing loved ones in early</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        Maisage also helps you bring your loved ones into the picture early — not to burden them, but to give them
        awareness and clarity long before decisions become urgent.
      </p>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        When everyone understands your preferences, routines, and comfort level ahead of time, your family can support you
        in ways that feel manageable for them and meaningful for you.
        Early conversations prevent confusion, reduce stress, and make sure your wishes are honored without guesswork.
