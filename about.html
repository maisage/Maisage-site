        Maisage was created to give you clearer information, calmer options, and more control

    <!-- Founding Story -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
        A personal beginning
      </h2>

      <div class="space-y-3 text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Maisage began from a deeply personal place — born out of love, exhaustion, and a quiet
          realization that while there is a huge amount of information about aging and support
          out there, very little of it is clear, connected, or easy for families to use.
        </p>

        <p>
          I watched my mother, my mother-in-law, and now my husband’s brother each walk their own
          end-of-life path. Every one of them faced a maze of paperwork, inflated costs, and
          missing information. People were trying their best, but the system was scattered,
          confusing, and rarely explained in plain language.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over and over, I heard the same sentence — from doctors, social workers, friends, even
          other families trying to help:
        </p>

        <p class="italic pl-4 border-l-2 border-emerald-200 text-slate-800">
          “When the money runs out, Medicaid will take over.”
        </p>

        <p>
          That single line has quietly become the “default plan” for aging in America.
          It’s what many families hold onto when savings start to thin out — not because it’s
          what they truly want, but because no one has shown them other paths in a way that
          feels understandable and doable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Medicaid is an essential safety net. But it was never meant to be the only plan.
          It generally steps in when independence is already gone — when where you live,
          what support you get, and what choices you have are mostly decided by systems,
          not by you.
        </p>

        <p>
          And the people making those decisions? Too often, they haven’t had much day-to-day
          interaction with you in years. Estranged adult children, ex-spouses, or distant
          siblings may suddenly step in. Health-care professionals who have only known you
          for a week or two are left to decide how you’ll live the rest of your life.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s a little like dating someone for a few weeks, then getting married and expecting
          a lifetime of understanding. Those decisions often fall in full crisis mode — rushed,
          emotional, and backed into a corner. It is not fair to you, and it’s not fair to the
          person who has to step in and decide under pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Maisage was built to change that pattern.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of waiting for the system to decide for you, Maisage helps you filter through
          the massive amount of information available, understand the rules and structures that
          shape your options, and build a care and life plan for your later years that actually
          reflects who you are.
        </p>

        <p>
          It arms you with knowledge and information to enable you to make informed decisions —
          not just about medical care, but about where you live, how you’re supported, how your
          money is used, and how your family is involved. That includes, but is not limited to,
          hospice or end-of-life care. It also covers everyday realities like staying at home
          longer with support, using ordinary services wisely, and knowing when facility care
          may become necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
          Maisage also recognizes that you don’t live this alone. Family and loved ones are
          part of the picture — but they shouldn’t only be called in at the last minute. This
          platform is meant to help you bring them into the conversation earlier, in a way that
          is manageable for them and still centered on you.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal is simple: fewer decisions made in the heat of a crisis, and more made with
          calm, clarity, and a shared understanding of what matters most to you.
