          Why Maisage exists — and who it’s for
        </h1>
        <p class="mt-4 text-slate-600 max-w-3xl">
          Maisage was created to give people and families clear, grounded guidance for aging,
          care, and end-of-life decisions — without sales, pressure, or hidden financial interests.
          It’s a place to understand the full cost picture, plan ahead, and keep control of your own life
          for as long as possible.

      <!-- Founding story -->
      <section class="bg-slate-50 border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl p-6 sm:p-8 space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">The founding story</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-700">
          Maisage began from a deeply personal place — born out of love, exhaustion, and a quiet realization
          that the system meant to support aging adults often abandons them instead.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700">
          I watched my mother, my mother-in-law, and now my husband’s brother each walk their own
          end-of-life path. Every one of them faced a maze of paperwork, inflated costs, and missing information.
          Families weren’t failing their loved ones — the system was failing the families.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700">
          Over and over, I heard the same sentence — from doctors, social workers, friends, even other families
          trying to help:
        </p>
        <p class="italic text-slate-800">
          “When the money runs out, Medicaid will take over.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700">
          That single line has become the unspoken plan for aging in America.
          It’s what most families cling to when the money dwindles, because no one has shown them another way.
          But Medicaid, while essential, was never meant to be the only plan. It takes over when independence
          is already gone — when choices are no longer your own.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700">
          And the people making those choices? Too often, they barely know you. Estranged adult children,
          ex-spouses, or distant siblings suddenly step in after years of silence. Health-care professionals
          who’ve only known you for a week or two are left to decide how you’ll live the rest of your life.
          Decisions about your future are made by people who have never lived your life.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700">
          I built Maisage to change that pattern.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700">
          Maisage exists primarily to guide you — to help you take control of your own aging,
          stay independent longer, and design an ending that reflects who you are. It shows how to plan
          for in-home hospice care, understanding what’s covered and what isn’t, so you can stay where you’re
          most comfortable without financial or emotional surprises. It also helps you engage your family in ways
          that are manageable for them and meaningful for you, giving everyone a shared map instead of a
          last-minute crisis.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700">
          Maisage isn’t about managing care — it’s about managing life with foresight, grace, and self-respect.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700">
          It’s for anyone who wants to make the next 30 years as intentional and independent as the life
          they’ve already lived.
        </p>
        <p class="font-medium text-slate-900">
          Let’s make the next 30 years on your terms — just as your life has been.
