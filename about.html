          Why Maisage exists — and who it’s for
        </h1>
        <p class="mt-4 text-slate-700 max-w-3xl">
          Maisage was created to give people and families clear, grounded guidance for aging,
          care, and end-of-life decisions — without sales pressure, hidden incentives, or confusing jargon.
          Its purpose is to help you understand the full cost picture, plan ahead, and stay in control
          of your own life for as long as possible.

      <!-- Founding Story -->
      <section class="bg-slate-50 border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl p-6 sm:p-8 space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">The founding story</h2>

        <p class="text-slate-700">
          Maisage began from a deeply personal place — born out of love, exhaustion, and a quiet realization
          that the system meant to support aging adults often abandons them instead.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-700">
          I watched my mother, my mother-in-law, and now my husband’s brother each walk their own
          end-of-life path. Every one of them faced a maze of paperwork, inflated costs, and missing information.
          Families weren’t failing their loved ones — the system was failing the families.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-700">
          Over and over, I heard the same sentence — from doctors, social workers, friends, even other families:
        </p>

        <p class="italic text-slate-800 text-lg">
          “When the money runs out, Medicaid will take over.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-700">
          That single line has become the unspoken plan for aging in America. Families cling to it because
          no one shows them another path. Medicaid, while essential, was never meant to be the only plan —
          it steps in when independence is already gone.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-700">
          And the people making decisions at that point? Often they barely know you — estranged family,
          ex-spouses, or healthcare professionals who have known you for only days. Decisions about the
          rest of your life can end up made by people who were never part of your life.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-700">
          I built Maisage to change that pattern.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-700">
          Maisage exists to help you take control of your own aging, stay independent longer,
          and design an ending that reflects your values. It guides you through in-home hospice planning,
          understanding coverage, and engaging family in ways that are meaningful and manageable —
          before the crisis arrives.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-700">
          Maisage isn’t about managing care — it’s about managing life with foresight, grace, and self-respect.
          It’s for anyone who wants to make the next 30 years as intentional as the life they’ve already lived.
        </p>

        <p class="font-semibold text-slate-900">
          Let’s make the next 30 years on your terms — just as your life has been.
