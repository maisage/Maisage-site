        Why Maisage exists
      </h1>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Maisage began from a deeply personal place — born out of love, exhaustion, and a quiet realization
        that the information meant to support aging adults is often scattered, confusing, and hard to act on.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        I watched my mother, my mother-in-law, and now my husband’s brother each walk their own end-of-life
        path. Every one of them faced a maze of paperwork, inflated costs, and missing information. Families
        were trying to do the right thing, but they were constantly bumping into rules, programs, and
        financial realities that no one had clearly explained.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Over and over, I heard the same sentence — from doctors, social workers, friends, and other families:
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-900 italic">
        “When the money runs out, Medicaid will take over.”
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        That single line has quietly become the “default plan” for aging in America. It’s what many families
        cling to when savings start to run low, because no one has walked them through other paths in a
        practical, transparent way. But Medicaid, while essential, was never meant to be the only plan. It
        often steps in when independence is already gone and choices are narrowed.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        And the people making those choices? Too often, they haven’t had much day-to-day interaction with you
        for any meaningful length of time. It’s a little like deciding to marry someone after only a few weeks
        and expecting a lifetime of deep understanding — except now it’s about your health, your comfort, and
        your future. Decisions fall in crisis mode, and everyone scrambles.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        It is not fair to you, and it is certainly not fair to the person who suddenly has to step in and make
        decisions with limited context and limited time.
      </p>

        What Maisage is here to do
      </h2>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Maisage exists to help filter through the massive amount of information that’s already out there and
        guide you toward a golden-years life plan that actually makes sense for you.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        It doesn’t sell products, manage investments, or replace your professionals. Instead, it focuses on
        helping you understand the landscape — how programs, costs, and care options fit together — so you
        can plan with open eyes instead of reacting in a crisis.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Maisage:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>organizes public information into clear, practical explanations</li>
        <li>arms you with knowledge and information to enable you to make informed decisions</li>
        <li>helps you think through how medication costs, care settings, and support services affect your plan</li>
        <li>encourages you to bring family into the conversation early — for awareness, not just emergencies</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        The goal isn’t to manage your care for you. The goal is to help you stay in control of your own
        choices for as long as possible, and to give your loved ones a clearer map instead of a last-minute
        scramble when something goes wrong.

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-emerald-900/90">
        You don’t have to solve everything at once. A good first step is simply understanding what’s on the
        table — how Medicare, Medicaid, medication costs, housing, and day-to-day support fit together for
        you. From there, you can start building a plan and bringing the right people into the loop.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-emerald-900/90">
        If you’d like to explore your situation in more detail, you can start with a simple form and a
        conversation.
