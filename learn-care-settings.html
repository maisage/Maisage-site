      </h1>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700 max-w-3xl">
        Many buildings look the same from the outside — but “assisted living,” “memory care,”
        “skilled nursing,” and “independent living” all follow different rules, have different
        expectations, and are paid for in different ways. This page uses publicly available
        information to explain the basics in plain language.
      </p>

      <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-slate-600">

        recommend any specific facility or product.

    </section>

    <!-- Independent Living -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Independent living (senior apartments, 55+ communities)</h2>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Independent living is usually housing for older adults who can live mostly on their own,
        with optional services layered on top.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>Looks like apartments or cottages.</li>
        <li>Often age-restricted (55+ or 62+).</li>
        <li>Focus is on housing, not hands-on care.</li>
        <li>Meals, housekeeping, and transportation may be offered as extras.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        <strong>Payment:</strong> Usually private pay (rent + optional services). Medicare and Medicaid
        generally do not pay for rent here.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Assisted Living -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Assisted living</h2>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Assisted living is designed for people who need help with daily activities but do not
        require full nursing home care.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>Help with dressing, bathing, medications, meals, and housekeeping.</li>
        <li>Staff on site, but not the same level as a hospital or nursing home.</li>
        <li>Private or semi-private apartments/rooms with shared dining and activities.</li>
        <li>Some memory care units are located inside assisted living communities.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        <strong>Payment:</strong> Mostly private pay. Some states have Medicaid waiver programs that
        help with <em>services</em>, but families usually still pay room and board.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Memory Care -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Memory care</h2>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Memory care is structured for people with Alzheimer’s disease or other dementias who need
        a secure environment and more cueing or supervision.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>Secure units or buildings to reduce wandering risk.</li>
        <li>Staff trained in dementia communication and behavior support.</li>
        <li>Routines and activities tailored for memory support.</li>
        <li>Often located inside assisted living or as stand-alone communities.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        <strong>Payment:</strong> Largely private pay. Medicaid coverage, where available, often
        helps with services but not room and board. Rules vary by state.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Skilled Nursing / Nursing Home -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Skilled nursing facilities (nursing homes)</h2>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Nursing homes provide the highest level of ongoing medical and personal care outside a hospital.
        They may have both short-stay rehab and long-term care units.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>24-hour nursing supervision.</li>
        <li>Help with all activities of daily living.</li>
        <li>Medication management and medical monitoring.</li>
        <li>On-site or visiting therapies (physical, occupational, speech).</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        <strong>Payment:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>Medicare: often covers short-term rehab after a qualifying hospital stay.</li>
        <li>Medicaid: the main payer for long-term nursing home care for people who qualify financially and medically.</li>
        <li>Private pay: families may pay out of pocket until Medicaid eligibility is met.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Short-Term Rehab vs Long-Term -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Short-term rehab vs. long-term placement</h2>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        The same building may serve two very different roles:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Short-term rehab:</strong> focused on recovery after hospitalization or surgery, usually for days to weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-term care:</strong> ongoing residence for those who cannot return home safely.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        Families often don’t realize when a stay is shifting from “temporary rehab” to “long-term,”
        which has very different financial and emotional implications.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Questions to Ask -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Questions to ask any facility</h2>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Regardless of level of care, families can use publicly available information and direct questions
        to get a clearer picture:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>How is this setting licensed in this state?</li>
        <li>What care is included in the base rate, and what costs extra?</li>
        <li>Do you accept Medicaid now? If so, under what circumstances?</li>
        <li>How many residents here are on Medicaid or assistance programs?</li>
        <li>What happens if a resident’s money runs out?</li>
        <li>How are staffing levels monitored and reported?</li>
        <li>Can I review recent inspection or survey reports?</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        Public reports (such as state inspections and federal datasets) can provide additional context,
        but they rarely tell the full story on their own.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Planning & Fit -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Matching setting to needs and preferences</h2>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        No single care setting fits everyone. Choosing between staying home, moving to assisted
        living, or transitioning to nursing home care often depends on:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>how much daily help is needed</li>
        <li>medical complexity and safety risks</li>
        <li>budget and benefit options (Medicare, Medicaid, VA, private pay)</li>
        <li>location and proximity to family</li>
        <li>personal preferences about privacy, community, and routine</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        Understanding how each setting works makes it easier to weigh options instead of deciding
        in fear or confusion.
