        Planning is not about predicting every detail of the future. It is about understanding what
        your likely options look like, how they are paid for, and what they mean for your
        independence and your family. This page focuses on the practical side of planning: long-term
        care, home help, housing, and how to think about costs over time.

        The goal here is not to sell any product or guarantee a specific outcome. Instead, Maisage
        aims to help you see the shape of your choices so you can make deliberate decisions while
        you still have time and options.

            Using a mix of in-home caregivers, ordinary services (meals, cleaning, transportation),
            and family check-ins to extend your independence without immediately moving into a
            facility.

            Thinking through assisted living, memory care, or nursing facilities — not as a single

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700 max-w-3xl">
        Sometimes the easiest way to understand planning is to see example situations. The family
        scenarios page walks through illustrative paths — such as a Medicaid spend-down, a blended
        family-support model, or using home equity — and shows how control, cost, and timing change
        across each approach.

          Over time, this section can grow into interactive tools — for example, a long-term care

          how long different funding combinations might last under various assumptions.
