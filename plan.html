      <p class="mt-4 text-slate-700 max-w-3xl">
        This page helps you think through the <strong>next phase of life</strong> — where you want to live,
        how you want to be supported, and how to make the money and help last as long as possible.
        Maisage doesn’t manage money or sell products. The goal is to help you see your options clearly.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-3 text-slate-700">
        If Learn explains how the systems work, Plan is about how you might actually use — or avoid —
        those systems in a way that fits your life.

    <!-- How this page helps -->
    <section class="border border-slate-200 bg-slate-50 rounded-2xl p-6 space-y-3">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">What this page is — and isn’t</h2>

      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>It <strong>is</strong> a guide to help you frame decisions about home, care, and money.</li>
        <li>It <strong>is not</strong> financial, legal, or medical advice.</li>
        <li>It <strong>is</strong> about making tradeoffs visible before you are in crisis.</li>
        <li>It <strong>is not</strong> a substitute for talking with your family and professionals.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500">
        Maisage stays neutral. We don’t tell you what to choose — we help you understand what each choice could mean.

    <!-- Planning horizon -->
    <section class="space-y-3">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-900">Start with your time horizon</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        Planning looks different if you’re thinking about the next 2 years versus the next 20.
        A simple way to start is to think in three buckets:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1 mt-1">
        <li><strong>Near term (0–3 years):</strong> current home, early supports, safety and stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Mid term (3–10 years):</strong> likely changes in health, mobility, and income.</li>
        <li><strong>Later term (10+ years):</strong> higher care needs, end-of-life preferences, who will decide what.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700 mt-2">
        You don’t have to predict everything. The goal is to accept that needs and costs will change
        and to build flexibility into your plan.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Core paths -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-900">Three common paths people plan around</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        Most real plans are some mix of these, but it helps to see the main paths clearly:
      </p>

      <div class="grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-3">

        <div class="border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-emerald-800">
            Staying at home
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-700">
            Focus on keeping you in your own home or apartment as long as possible —
            with layered support from family, paid helpers, and community services.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-emerald-800">
            Hybrid / step-down
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-700">
            Start at home with support, then move to assisted living or similar when safety,
            isolation, or care needs change too much.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-emerald-800">
            Facility-first
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-700">
            Move earlier to a setting that can increase care as you need it — sometimes better
            for those with high medical needs or little informal support.
          </p>
        </div>

      </div>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        The <a href="scenarios.html" class="text-emerald-700 hover:underline">Scenarios</a> page walks through
        example versions of these paths using simplified numbers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Basic budget frame -->
    <section class="space-y-3">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-900">A simple way to frame the money side</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        You don’t need a complicated spreadsheet to start. A basic planning frame can look like this:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1 mt-1">
        <li><strong>Monthly income:</strong> Social Security, pension, annuities, rent, part-time work.</li>
        <li><strong>Fixed monthly expenses:</strong> housing, utilities, insurance, medications, debts.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible costs:</strong> food, transport, personal spending.</li>
        <li><strong>Care & support costs:</strong> help at home, adult day programs, assisted living, respite.</li>
        <li><strong>Savings / assets:</strong> cash, investments, home equity.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700 mt-2">
        The goal is to see: <strong>How long does your money carry your preferred path</strong> —
        and what happens if health or support needs change earlier than expected.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Family help vs Medicaid -->
    <section class="space-y-3">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-900">Family help and Medicaid – not either/or</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        Many families are told, “When the money runs out, Medicaid will take over.”
        That might eventually be true, but it skips over years of possible choices.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-slate-700 mt-2">Questions to consider:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>How much support (time or money) can family realistically provide without burning out?</li>
        <li>Is there a way to use family help to <strong>delay</strong> a spend-down to Medicaid?</li>
        <li>Are there assets you want to protect — or is the priority maximum care and comfort?</li>
        <li>Does everyone understand that Medicaid coverage may limit choices later?</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700 mt-2">
        The goal is not to avoid Medicaid at all costs — it’s to avoid <strong>surprise</strong>.
        You want to know how far family help and private resources can go, and what happens when they are gone.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        The <a href="scenarios.html" class="text-emerald-700 hover:underline">Scenarios</a> page can help
        you visualize different combinations of family support, private pay, and Medicaid.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Non-medical supports -->
    <section class="space-y-3">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-900">Using ordinary services to stretch independence</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        A lot of support for aging independently doesn’t come from “healthcare” at all. It comes from
        regular services that many people already use — they just haven’t thought of them as part of a plan.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1 mt-1">
        <li>Grocery delivery or meal services.</li>
        <li>Cleaning or laundry help once or twice a month.</li>
        <li>Rideshare, senior transport, or community shuttle.</li>
        <li>Yard work or handyman services.</li>
        <li>Automated bill pay and medication reminders.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700 mt-2">
        Each of these may cost far less per month than a major move or facility,
        and together they can delay the point where intensive care is needed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Questions to ask providers -->
    <section class="space-y-3">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-900">Questions to ask before choosing a path</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        Whether you’re talking to a home care agency, assisted living, or a financial professional,
        having a few core questions ready can protect you from surprises.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1 mt-1">
        <li>What does your service <strong>not</strong> include that people often assume it does?</li>
        <li>How often do your prices increase, and how much notice do you give?</li>
        <li>What happens if my care needs increase — can you support that, or would I need to move?</li>
        <li>What happens if I outlive my savings — do you accept Medicaid or other programs?</li>
        <li>Can you give an example of a client whose situation changed and how it was handled?</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500 mt-1">
        These questions don’t guarantee a perfect outcome, but they often reveal hidden assumptions early,
        when you still have room to adjust.
