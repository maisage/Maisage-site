        Keep your plan in one place — without giving up control
      </h1>

      <p class="mt-4 text-slate-700 max-w-3xl">
        Maisage starts as a free resource: plain-language guides, planning ideas, and tools you can print
        or adapt on your own. Membership and paid reports are optional layers for people who want more structure,
        storage, or help turning all the pieces into one clear plan.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-3 text-slate-700">
        The goal is simple: <strong>cover the cost of thoughtful work</strong> without turning your decisions
        into a sales funnel.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Money and transparency come together here</h2>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        If Maisage ever offers paid options, they will follow the same rules as the free content:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>No commissions, referral fees, or kickbacks from providers, plans, or products.</li>
        <li>Clear, simple pricing — no surprise add-ons.</li>
        <li>You keep ownership of your decisions. We help you see options, not choose for you.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500">
        Anything described on this page is about structure and intent. Actual pricing and availability
        may change over time and should always be confirmed on the most current version of this site.

    <!-- Free layer -->
    <section class="space-y-3">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-900">Free layer – use the tools without paying a cent</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        The free layer is for anyone who wants to learn, plan, and compare options on their own, using public
        information and simple frameworks.
      </p>

      <div class="border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl p-4 mt-2">
        <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-emerald-800">

        </h3>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc ml-5 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Learn:</strong> plain-language guides on Medicare, Medicaid, hospice, and medicines.</li>
          <li><strong>Plan:</strong> frameworks for thinking about home, care paths, and long-term costs.</li>

          <li><strong>Living Map:</strong> a method for building your own local view of options and costs.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500">
        You can use the free materials privately, with your family, or with professionals you already trust.

    <!-- Membership concept -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-900">Membership – for people who want structure and tracking</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        A future membership option is intended for people who want a private place to save their inputs,
        track revisions, and get guided prompts — without turning their data into a product.
      </p>

      <div class="grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2">
        <div class="border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl p-4">
          <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-emerald-800">
            What membership is meant to include
          </h3>
          <ul class="mt-2 list-disc ml-5 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
            <li>Digital versions of planning tools with saved entries.</li>
            <li>A simple dashboard to see key details in one view (income, supports, care paths).</li>
            <li>History of changes, so you can see how your plan has evolved.</li>
            <li>Guided questions based on what you’ve already entered — not random checklists.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl p-4">

          </h3>
          <ul class="mt-2 list-disc ml-5 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
            <li>Simple monthly range (for example, around $10–$15/month) if/when membership launches.</li>
            <li>No long-term contracts or lock-ins — cancel whenever it stops being useful.</li>
            <li>Clear explanation of what is and is not included before you pay anything.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500">
        Exact pricing and features may change. The constant is the commitment to neutrality and transparency.

    <!-- One-time report -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-900">Personalized “Family Aging Plan” report</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-700">
        Some families don’t want a subscription. They want a one-time, structured document they can print,
        share, and update on their own. A future option is a personalized “Family Aging Plan” PDF.
      </p>

      <div class="border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl p-4">
        <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-emerald-800">
          What this type of report could include
        </h3>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc ml-5 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
          <li>Summary of your current situation (in your own words, organized clearly).</li>
          <li>Overview of likely care paths you’re considering (home, hybrid, facility-first, etc.).</li>
          <li>Pros, limitations, and questions to ask for each path — tailored to your inputs.</li>
          <li>Space for notes from family meetings and professional conversations.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        A sample price point for this type of report might be in the range of <strong>around $75</strong>,
        depending on how much human review is included. The exact structure and pricing would be clearly
        listed whenever this becomes available.
      </p>

      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500">
        The goal is to pay for the time and thinking involved — not to steer you toward any particular product,
        provider, or legal/financial decision.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Common questions</h2>

      <div class="space-y-3 text-sm text-slate-700">
        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold">Does paying for membership change the advice I get?</p>
          <p>
            No. Paying would only change the <em>format</em> (dashboards, storage, reports),
            not the values or neutrality. Maisage does not receive money from providers, plans,
            or products — only from you, if you choose to pay for extra structure.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold">Will my information be used for marketing?</p>
          <p>
            The intent is to keep any collected information limited to your use and necessary service
            operation — not to sell or lease it to third parties. Details would be spelled out in any
            future privacy policy before you sign up.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold">Is this a replacement for professional advice?</p>
          <p>
            No. Membership and reports are for clarity, organization, and navigation. They are not legal,
            financial, or medical advice and do not replace working with licensed professionals.
