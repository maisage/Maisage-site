        Hospice care: what it does—and what it does not—cover
      </h1>
      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Hospice is a model of care focused on comfort, symptom management, and quality of life when
        a serious illness is not expected to be cured. It is about support and dignity, not giving
        up. Many people and families are surprised by what hospice does and does not pay for.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-slate-500">
        Coverage details depend on the payer (for example, Medicare vs. private insurance) and local
        policies. This page focuses on general patterns that are often misunderstood.

        What hospice is designed to provide
      </h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        Hospice services commonly include:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1.5">
        <li>Regular visits from a hospice team (nurses, aides, social workers, chaplains).</li>
        <li>Medications related to comfort and symptom control for the terminal diagnosis.</li>
        <li>Certain medical equipment and supplies (for example, hospital bed, oxygen, dressings).</li>
        <li>Support for caregivers, including training, respite options, and grief support.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-slate-500">
        Hospice care can be provided at home, in a facility, or in dedicated inpatient hospice
        units, depending on the situation and local availability.

        A key point: hospice usually does not pay for room and board
      </h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        One of the most important clarifications is that hospice <span class="font-semibold">does
        not usually cover room and board costs</span> in a facility such as assisted living or a
        nursing home.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1.5">
        <li>Hospice may pay for the hospice team and related services.</li>
        <li>The daily “bed” charge in a facility is often billed separately and remains the patient’s or family’s responsibility, unless another payer (like Medicaid) is involved.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-slate-500">
        This distinction can have a major impact on costs, especially if someone moves to a
        facility for the first time while starting hospice.

      <h2 class="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
        Hospice at home versus in a facility
      </h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        Many people receive hospice at home, where the patient or family does not pay “room and
        board” in the same way. The main questions at home often involve:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1.5">
        <li>Who will provide day-to-day hands-on care?</li>
        <li>Whether additional paid caregivers are needed, beyond what hospice staff can provide.</li>
        <li>How family and friends can share responsibilities in a manageable way.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-xs sm:text-sm text-slate-500">
        In a facility, the hospice team is added on top of the facility’s own staff and charges,
        which can make the financial picture more complex.
