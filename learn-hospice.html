        Hospice care focuses on comfort, dignity, and support in the final phase of life. Many
        families are surprised by what hospice covers — and what it does not. Understanding this
        early helps you prepare emotionally, financially, and practically.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">What hospice actually is</h2>
      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Hospice is comfort-focused care for people with a life expectancy of six months or less,
        as certified by physicians. The focus shifts from curative treatment to:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>relief from pain and symptoms</li>
        <li>emotional and spiritual support</li>
        <li>comfort and dignity in the final stage of life</li>
        <li>family guidance and support</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        Hospice is not giving up. It is choosing comfort, calm, and quality of life.

    <!-- What Hospice Covers -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">What hospice usually covers</h2>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">Hospice typically includes:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>nursing visits and symptom management</li>
        <li>medications related to comfort and pain control</li>
        <li>medical equipment such as hospital beds, wheelchairs, oxygen</li>
        <li>home health aides for brief personal care</li>
        <li>access to social workers, chaplains, and counselors</li>
        <li>24/7 on-call support for emergencies or symptom changes</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        These services can take place at home, in assisted living, in a facility, or at a hospice center.

    <!-- What Hospice Does NOT Cover -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-700">What hospice does NOT cover</h2>

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Many families discover this too late — hospice does <strong>not</strong> pay for:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Room and board</strong> in assisted living, memory care, or nursing homes</li>
        <li><strong>24/7 caregivers</strong> at home (Medicare does not cover round-the-clock sitters)</li>
        <li><strong>Non-medical help</strong> like cleaning, laundry, cooking, shopping</li>
        <li><strong>Private-duty caregivers</strong> unless paid separately by the family</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700 font-medium">
        This is one of the most important things to understand about hospice:  
        <span class="text-red-700">Hospice provides medical support — not daily living support.</span>

    <!-- Hospice at Home -->

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Hospice at home</h2>
      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Many older adults prefer to remain at home. Hospice can help make that possible, but families
        need to understand the balance:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-1">
        <li>nurses visit a few times a week (more if needed)</li>
        <li>aides visit briefly for bathing or personal care</li>
        <li>most day-to-day support still falls to family or hired caregivers</li>
        <li>hospice provides equipment, supplies, and medications related to comfort</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        For many families, combining hospice + part-time caregiver support + family coordination
        provides the most comfort and stability.

        Hospice in assisted living or nursing homes

      <p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-700">
        Hospice can be added wherever someone lives — but the facility still charges its usual
        monthly rent or daily rate. Hospice covers the medical layer; the facility covers the care layer.
